### Locally Populating Dictionary Data
To populate the database complete the following steps:

### 1. Build a Dictionary

The following command places the JSON dictionaries in the `build/` directory:

```
yarn build:dictionaries
```

Here's an example JSON dictionary file: [ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json)

### 2. Populate the MongoDB Database

Now that the data has been parsed, it needs to be used to populate, or seed, the MongoDB database.

Start the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Then make a `POST` request to the following route:

```
/api/v1/test/populate
```

For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/populate // POST
```

After about 20 seconds, if you see the `âœ… Seeding successful.` message in your terminal, then you have successfully populated your database.

### 3. Migrate Data (Optional)

The database has gone through a number of migrations since the beginning of this project. To ensure that local testing data is the same
shape as the data in the production MongoDB database, run all MongoDB migration scripts with the following command:

```
yarn migrate-up
```

### 4. View Data in Database (Optional)

Now that the data is living in a local database, you can see it either using the `mongo` command line tool, or through [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
